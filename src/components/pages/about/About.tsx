                            Hi! I'm Pharthiwath Gristsoopharruth, a Computer Science student at Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, based in Bangkok, Thailand.
                            I'm passionate about full-stack development and have a strong interest in cybersecurity.
                            Iâ€™ve worked on several projects including <a href="https://github.com/MrWinRock/stringy" className="text-blue-400 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stringy</a>,
                            a blog platform for IT discussions, and <a href="https://github.com/MrWinRock/chadchat" className="text-blue-400 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chadchat</a>,
                            a simple real-time one-on-one chat application.
                            Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, exploring cybersecurity, watching football, and motorsport.
                            My goal is to grow into a senior role in the computer science field and contribute to impactful, secure software systems.

                            I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, with a GPA of 3.66.
                            My studies focus on artificial intelligence, full-stack web and mobile application development, backend systems, and cybersecurity.
                            This academic foundation, combined with hands-on projects, is shaping me into a versatile and forward-thinking developer.
